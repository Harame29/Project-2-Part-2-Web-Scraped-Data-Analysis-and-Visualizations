NBA Web Scraping Project
Student: Hannah Raquel Melio
Course: Data Science Programming (CMP-262-86511)

This project uses Python to scrape NBA data from five pages on Basketball-Reference.com. I loaded the tables with pandas, did light cleaning, and kept everything at a beginner level.

I used simple scraping with requests and pandas.read_html() to collect the data. After that, I organized it in DataFrames and created clear bar charts using Seaborn in medium orchid and light purple.

The notebook answers five questions: how scoring changes with age, which teams have the most assists, which players improved the most from last season, how LeBron compares to league averages, and whether he performs better in the regular season or playoffs.

The repository includes one Jupyter Notebook with all scraping, cleaning, analysis, visualizations, and markdown explanations written in plain language.

To run the project, install the basic libraries, open the notebook, and click “Run All.” This assignment helped me practice beginner web scraping, simple data cleaning, and basic analysis using real NBA statistics.
